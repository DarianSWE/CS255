DriverPass Project
Project Overview

DriverPass is an application designed to assist student drivers in better preparing for their driving tests. The platform allows users to reserve and book practice sessions, both for the written and driving portions of the test, ultimately helping them pass with confidence.

Client

The client for this project is Liam, the owner of DriverPass. Liam wanted a system that would enable student drivers to seamlessly book and reserve practice time, ensuring they are thoroughly prepared for their driving exams.

What I Did Well

In this project, I excelled at showcasing the functional and non-functional requirements, ensuring that the system met all specified needs. Additionally, I effectively identified potential limitations, providing a clear picture of the system’s capabilities and constraints.

Areas for Improvement

If I could revise one aspect of my work, it would be the diagrams I created. While they served their purpose, I believe they could be more organized and easier to read. Improving the clarity and layout of these diagrams would enhance the overall understanding of the system design.

Understanding and Implementing User Needs

I made it a priority to fully interpret the user’s needs and translate them into the system design. This involved thinking outside the box and ensuring that all aspects were communicated in non-technical terms, making the information accessible to all stakeholders. Considering the user’s needs is crucial in system design because overlooking any detail can lead to delays and increased costs for the project.

Approach to Software Design

My approach to designing software begins with a strong focus on the functional and non-functional requirements after gathering the user’s needs. I believe in paying attention to every detail, which is why system design and business requirement documents are so important. In future projects, I plan to continue refining my techniques, with an emphasis on clear communication and thorough analysis to ensure the system meets all user expectations.
